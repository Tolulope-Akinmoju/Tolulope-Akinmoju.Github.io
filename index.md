A neglect of A/R is a major cause of revenue leakage in healthcare and as such the need for AR management and follow up. The goal of A/R analysis is to increase revenue collection for the clinic by ensuring services rendered are paid for accurately and promptly. For this project, I took on the role of a junior revenue cycle consultant to a dermatology clinic. My goal was to understand the current status of their Accounts Receivables and provide recommendations that addresses the possible issues.

Claim Denials are pain point, and the overall aim of denial management is to identify and mitigate potential denials. Appeals and resubmission of claims cost practice money that could have been reinvested into the practice. In this project, I worked as the revenue cycle analyst to a small clinic and was charged with the responsibility of identifying current issues behind denials whilst also suggesting ways to reduce and possibly prevent future occurrence of same.
